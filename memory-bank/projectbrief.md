# Design Case Craft Kit - Project Brief

## Project Overview
This project is a portfolio website for a Senior Product Designer showcasing expertise in UI/UX design, AI-driven design processes, and interactive case studies. The site highlights various design projects, including AI-assisted tools, 3D motion designs, and case studies for clients like Tesla and TXCMS.

Key goals:
- Demonstrate design skills through interactive case studies.
- Integrate AI for dynamic content generation and design ideation.
- Provide an engaging user experience with modern web technologies (React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Vite).

## Designer Profile
- **Name**: [Your Name] (Senior Product Designer)
- **Experience**: 10+ years in product design, specializing in digital experiences, mobile apps, and web interfaces.
- **Skills**:
  - UI/UX Design: Figma, Sketch, Adobe XD

   - Crushy Case Study
   - Ecommerce Case Study
   - MindSpace Case Study
   - Gallery of miscellaneous designs (e.g., Bolt, Camel, Dash)

## AI Integration and Memory Bank
- The "memory bank" serves as a centralized repository for design briefs, prompts, assets, and iteration histories.
- Future expansions: JSON-based storage for AI queries, vector embeddings for semantic search of design elements.
- Initialization: This file establishes the baseline structure. Additional files can be added for specific case study data (e.g., ai-prompts.json, asset-index.md).

## Technical Stack
- Frontend: React 18, TypeScript, Vite
- Styling: Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui components
- Utilities: ESLint, PostCSS
- Deployment: Vercel

## Next Steps
- Populate memory bank with detailed case study data.
- Integrate AI APIs for dynamic content.
- Optimize for performance and accessibility.
